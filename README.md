# Stock-Price-Prediction
I'll take a look at the code in the uploaded notebook and then create a README file based on it.

The notebook contains code related to stock price prediction, and it involves the installation of libraries such as `yfinance`, `pandas`, and others. To create an effective README file, I'll outline the general structure and include specific details based on common practices for such projects.

# Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a basic implementation of a stock price prediction model using linear regression. It utilizes historical stock data to train the model and predict future stock prices. The code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a stock price prediction model using historical data and linear regression. The model is trained on data fetched from the Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`) and is intended for educational purposes. It offers a simple introduction to financial data analysis and machine learning.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Libraries:
  - `yfinance`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:

   You can install the necessary libraries using the following pip command:

   ```bash
   pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   You can open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab to run the code:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Copy of Project1.ipynb"
   ```

## Usage

1. **Download Historical Data**:
   
   The notebook uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock data. You can modify the ticker symbol in the notebook to predict prices for different stocks.

2. **Train the Model**:

   Run the cells in the notebook to train the linear regression model on the historical data.

3. **Make Predictions**:

   The notebook will output predicted prices for the stock. The predictions can be visualized using Matplotlib.

4. **Visualization**:

   The notebook includes code to visualize the historical and predicted prices.
